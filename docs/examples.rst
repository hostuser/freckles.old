Examples
========

Here I'll collect example configurations for commonly encountered use-cases. I figure it's probably more useful than the usage guides, because I hope the configuration syntax is simple enough to grasp so it'll be easy enough to understand what is going on by having a look at the configuration, without needing too much in the way of explanations.

This is the configuration used in the *freckles* Quickstart guide, explained in some detail in the 'Usage' page.
