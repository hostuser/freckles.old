# freckles quickstart example config
#
# this checks out a dotfiles repository that contains the configuration for
# an emacs-like editor (zile), as well as this configuration itself.
#
# once that is done, it installs zile (using the name(s) child-folder(s) of the top level
# dotfiles repo folder to determine which packages to install (zile in this case, the 
# exact package names can be configured in other places if necessary though -- the 'freckles'
# folder is ignored because it contains a '.no_install.frkl' marker file). this happens
# because the 'use_dotfiles' variable in the install directive is set to 'true' (default is 'false').
#
# alongside 'zile' we also install a list of packages that don't need any special configuration,
# 'htop' and the 'fortunes' application. because for 'fortunes' we want to install 2 additional
# packages with the main programm, we specify it under the 'pkgs' sub-key. this can also be used if
# a package is named differently in different distributions/package managers. in this case we could 
# easily just added all fortunes package names in the list under the 'packages' key (but we wanted 
# to show off how to do it using the 'pkgs' way).
#
# once all those packages are installed, all root-level child-folders of the dotfiles repo are 
# soft-linked into the users home directory (using 'stow' -- again ignoring the 'freckles' folder
# which contains a '.no_stow.frkl' marker file).
#
# the last part of this configuration is the directive to ensure a folder '.backups/zile' exists
# in the users home directory. we need this because we specified it in the zile configuration file
# that is contained in the dotfiles repo
