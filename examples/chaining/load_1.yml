# a very simple exaample of how to install packages using both an (existing) dotfiles directory and a list of packages. By default, values in the 'packages' var overwrite ones that are calculated via dotfile directories. That can be changed using the 'priority_source' variable

runs:
  - desc: install applications according to dotfiles directory
    vars:
      dotfiles:
        - ~/dotfiles-example
    tasks:
      - install

load:
  - gh:makkus:freckles:examples/chaining/load_2.yml
