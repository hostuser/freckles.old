vars:
  # dotfiles are used by both the install & stow freck, so we define them 'globally'. Could also define them as a 'run'-local variable though.
  dotfiles:
     - base_dir: ~/dotfiles-example
       remote: https://github.com/makkus/dotfiles-example.git

tasks:
  - checkout-dotfiles      # this should only be used for initial checkout, since it'd overwrite changes made locally, even if commited. This is the default behaviour of the ansible git module.
