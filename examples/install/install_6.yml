# a very simple exaample of how to install packages using both an (existing) dotfiles directory and a list of packages. By default, values in the 'packages' var overwrite ones that are calculated via dotfile directories. That can be changed using the 'priority_source' variable

runs:
  - desc: install applications according to dotfiles directory
    vars:
      pkg_mgr: git
      packages:
        - spacemacs:
            pkgs:
              - dest: ~/.emacs.d
                repo: https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs
    tasks:
      - install
