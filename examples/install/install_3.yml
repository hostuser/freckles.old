# a very simple exaample of how to install packages using both an (existing) dotfiles directory and a list of packages. By default, values in the 'packages' var overwrite ones that are calculated via dotfile directories. That can be changed using the 'priority_source' variable

# This example also shows a way to automatically install all package managers are required (as defined by the pkg_mgr variable, either on global, run or task level.

runs:
  - desc: install applications according to dotfiles directory
    vars:
      ensure_pkg_manager: yes   # default is 'no'
      update_cache: yes   # this is default anyway
      upgrade_packages: yes   # default is 'no'
      pkg_mgr: conda
      conda_channels:
        - conda-forge
      packages:
        - htop   # this will be installed using the default package manager (apt or yum probably)
        - babel
        - cowsay:
            pkg_mgr: nix
    tasks:
      - install
