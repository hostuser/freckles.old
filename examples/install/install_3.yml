# a very simple exaample of how to install packages using both an (existing) dotfiles directory and a list of packages. By default, values in the 'packages' var overwrite ones that are calculated via dotfile directories. That can be changed using the 'priority_source' variable

# This example also shows a way to automatically install all package managers are required (as defined by the pkg_mgr variable, either on global, run or task level.

runs:
  - desc: install applications according to dotfiles directory
    vars:
      ensure_pkg_manager: yes   # default is 'no'
      update_cache: yes   # this is default anyway
      upgrade_packages: yes   # default is 'no'
      add_path: yes   # defaults to 'no' if using 'ensure_pkg_manager' instead of 'manually' installing it using the install-pkg-manager freck
      pkg_mgr: conda
      conda_channels:
        - conda-forge
      packages:
        - htop  # isntalled using conda (from conda_channel 'conda-forge')
