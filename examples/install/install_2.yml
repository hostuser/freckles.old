# a very simple exaample of how to install packages using both an (existing) dotfiles directory and a list of packages. By default, values in the 'packages' var overwrite ones that are calculated via dotfile directories. That can be changed using the 'priority_source' variable

vars:
  pkg_mgr: nix
  packages:
    - htop:
        pkg_mgr: conda
        channels:
           - conda-forge
    - zile:
        pkg_mgr: nix
    - babel:
        pkg_mgr: conda
tasks:
  - install
