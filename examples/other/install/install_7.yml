# a very simple exaample of how to install packages using both an (existing) dotfiles directory and a list of packages. By default, values in the 'packages' var overwrite ones that are calculated via dotfile directories. That can be changed using the 'priority_source' variable

# This example also shows a way to automatically install all package managers are required (as defined by the pkg_mgr variable, either on global, run or task level.

vars:
  dotfiles:
     - base_dir: ~/dotfiles-example

  packages:
    - htop  # isntalled using conda (from conda_channel 'conda-forge')

  ensure_pkg_manager: yes
tasks:
  - checkout-dotfiles
